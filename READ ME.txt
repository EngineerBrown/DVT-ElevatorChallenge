DTV Elevator Challenge

1. The program when launched asks the user whether they wish to configure the Elevator or use default configurations
2. Elevator configurations include:
	Number  of elevators in the building
	Maximum Floors (max floors)
	Current Floor (which is randomly assigned at first)
	Underground/Basement Floors
3. If the user accepts default configurations the following values are set:
	No of Elevators: 2
	MaxFloors : 10
	CurrFloor: Random
	Underground/Basement Floors: 2
	Else the program accepts the configurations entered by the user.
4. After configurations are done the user may summon the elevator by selecting whether they are going up or down
5. The program calls the nearest elevator by comparing users currentFloor to each elevators currentFloor
6. The user is then able to 
	a. open/close doors
	b. add multiple destination floors
7. The program simulates movement to the next destination floor 
8. The program restricts weight and maximum occupants by keeping track of current occupants and their weight
